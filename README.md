## About project

This is my second game called Remagures. Remagures is RPG that I making since December 2021, in she will be lore, story and cool characters (I hope). I already done much mechanics, but code is very shitty and I need to rewrite much things :( 
But I hope that game will be awesome

# Specifics
 - Project uses architecture based on **SO and MonoBehaviours**(this is **BAD**)
 - Project is very big for me
 - In new modules I trying to use **MV** archiretcure and **OOP**
 - First project that I making not alone (I have an artist and scenarist)
 
# Tools
 - TMP
 - UniTask
 - Odin Inspector
 - Other little assets
 
## Conclusion

This project became my second full-fledged one, and during its development I understood and learned many things. In its initial form, the project had just a disgusting architecture, but over time I brought it to a better look. The project is still in development and probably will be for a long time, but it's a good experience to work with other people and relatively large projects. I hope it will turn out good and I will survive the rewriting of many things so that there is a full-fledged big project that I am not ashamed of and that can be expanded :)
