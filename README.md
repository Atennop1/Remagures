## About project

This is my second game called Remagures. I made it from December 2021 to May 2023 and it was supposed to be a pixel RPG game with its own lore, interesting mechanics and characters. But something went wrong.

### Project is now freeze/closed

I was forced to close the project and let down all the people who had a hand in its creation. Although there were few of them, I deeply regret that I could not bring this project to the end. 
<br>It was all due to my perfectionism and desire for a pure OOP approach, as well as my inexperience. When I started this project, my entire experience was in [**my first game**](https://github.com/Atennop1/Savanna-Sprint) and only in it. Charged with motivation and ideas for a new project, I began development. Everything seemed to be going well, but in the summer of 2022 I began to become interested in the code of the games, and not in the games themselves. As a result, I realized that the original code of this game, made using lessons from YouTube, is terrible and unsupported. 
As a result, in February 2023, when an artist came to the team and I decided to seriously take on the project, I was forced to rewrite all the shitty code that I wrote when I was young and stupid. At first everything went easy, but due to the large volume of the project,I ended up getting very burnt out, having almost completed everything. Right now the project is in the form of raw game systems and a composition layer, but all the systems have not been tested or assembled in the engine, so I cannot guarantee their correct operation. In fact, now it’s not even a game, but a set of systems in order to build a game. Maybe this code will help someone make their dream game, but definitely not for me. In addition, now I’m going to leave Unity and move to C++ development on proprietary engines and Unreal Engine.

Guys, I really won't be able to finish this project due to burnout and loss of interest. I was very mistaken when, with almost zero experience, I took on a huge dream project. Sorry guys, **I'm done**...
 
## Conclusion

It is difficult to overestimate the contribution of this project to my development as a programmer. Thanks to him, I felt what it was like to work on a large project, and became acquainted with many aspects of the engine that were previously unknown to me. It was also the first project that I did not do alone, I had an artist, although he appeared much later than I wanted. In the end, this project gave me the understanding that projects should **never** be rewritten. I really regret that I started this project when I was young and stupid, and in the end I was not able to finish everything.
